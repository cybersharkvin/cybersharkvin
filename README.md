### Hello, I'm Vince!

I'm currently an Associate Detection Engineer at [Nano Cyber Solutions](https://nanocybersolutions.com/)

Follow my journey into the world of Infosec at [Life After SOC](https://lifeaftersoc.substack.com), a blog series about overcoming the challenges infosec professionals face after making it into the field.

I defend others virtually as well as physically - I train in several martial arts, and I'm an active Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu competitor.
